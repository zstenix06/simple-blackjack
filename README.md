This is a simple blackjack game that I created in order to test out my skills in Javascript web application development. So please do not take this as a fully-fleshed out AAA title, thank you.

The game has an input field to enter in a bet amount, this can be left blank if your not into losing your life savings, but can be placed at any amount.
The total amount of winnings/losses updates after you bet again. So if you won $1000000 and you go back to the main menu and you don't see it. Don't worry as it populates once you start another game. (its a little weird i know)

Anyways, thats all there really is to the game as it is a SIMPLE blackjack game. I hope you enjoy it as this is one of many javascript-included websites I have made and I hope to increase my skills even more.

Thank you for reading, Zayden.
